Figure \ref{fig:RGUI} shows R's GUI, with the R Console. The R Console interprets the 
R commands and provides the output. Commands can be typed in directly, or a whole set
of commands can be run from a script that you can open in the R GUI or load from an external
file.


## The R Console
The R Console is the interpreter for R.

- Command can be typed in and ENTER key pressed. 
- The interpreter will examine the command and either prompt for more $+$ (continuiation prompt) or attempt to execute the command. 
- Comments: Any line begining with \texttt{\#} is a comment and is ignored. Anything after \texttt{\#} is ignored until end of line.
- Semicolons \texttt{;} can separate commands on same line
- Braces (\texttt{\{} and \texttt{\}}) can group commands together.
