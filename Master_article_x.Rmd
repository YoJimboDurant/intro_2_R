    | An Introduction to Rmarkdown
    | (with a few pro tips)
author: "[Brock Stewart](mailto:jnn6@cdc.gov?Subject=Your%20March%202017%20RUG%20Rmarkdown%20talk)"
institute: "CDC/DTBE"
abstract: "The Markdown language, created in 2004, provides a super-simple syntax for creating good-looking, professional documents in a wide range of formats, including HTML, LaTeX, and WORD.  Rmarkdown, created in 2014, allows us to include R code and its output in a Markdown document.  Given Rmarkdown's ease-of-use and continually-increasing feature set, you should now strongly consider creating all of your documents using Rmarkdown -- whether they contain R code and analyses or not -- including: notes to yourself; notes to colleagues; reports to colleagues; standardized recurring reports; scientific journal articles; and even public-facing web pages.  In this talk I will cover Markdown and Rmarkdown at an introductory level.  Since it's so simple and feature-rich, I'm sure by the end you'll feel confident and motivated enough to begin making your own documents with Rmarkdown."
