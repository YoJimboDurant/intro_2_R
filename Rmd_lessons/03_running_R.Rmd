Figure \ref{fig:RGUI} shows R's GUI, with the R Console. The R Console interprets the 
R commands and provides the output. Commands can be typed in directly, or a whole set
of commands can be run from a script that you can open in the R GUI or load from an external
file.

## The R Console
The R Console is the interpreter for R.

- Command can be typed in and ENTER key pressed.
- The interpreter will examine the command and either prompt for more  *+* (continuation prompt) or attempt to execute the command.
- Comments: Any line beginning with *#* is a comment and is ignored. Anything after is ignored until end of line.
- Semicolons can separate commands on same line
- Braces *{* and *}* can group commands together.

Features to note in RStudio:

- RStudio contains 4 main windows. 
- These windows can be adjusted or even repositioned inside the container.
- To open a new code listing, you select File -> New File -> Rscript.
- You can save the file with the extension ".R" so RStudio will know it is an R file next time you open it.
- You can type code into the console, or type it into your Rscript file. Highlight the portion of the code in the Rscript and press <Control> and <Enter> and it will run the highlighted code to the RConsole. 
- RStudio will highlight potential errors in your code as you type (linting)
- Information on the many hot keys and functionality in RStudio can be found at: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf
- For instance, you can place the cursor anywhere in your Rscript in RStudio and press *<Control>* and *B*, and RStudio will run your code from the start until it reaches the position of the cursor. You can also press *<Alt>* and *-* and RStudio will place and assignment (<-).
