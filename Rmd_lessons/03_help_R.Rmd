# R Basics and Getting Help

## Learning R 

  - HHS Learning Portal
    + Introduction to R Programming (PG_RPRG_A01_IT_ENUS, 2.2)
    + Books 24x7 (search for "R statistics")
  - Many resources but in my opinion the best option out there is [Coursera Data Science Specialization by John Hopkins](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
  - Swirl (http://swirlstats.com/)
     + Interactive learning using R
<article>
There are several resources available to help you learn R. At CDc. there are 
online classes (free) available for learning R at HHS university. There are also
books available online at Books 24/7 through HHS university. Massive Online Courses
(MOC's) such as coursera offer good instruction. Finally, if you are interested in 
using R to learn R - swirl is an excellent way to provide interactive lessons that 
teach you R as you use R.

## Getting Help 

  - `help.start()`
  - `help()`, `?help`
  - `help.search()`
  - Google search
  - StackOverflow
  - RUG listserv and R listserv

## help.start()
```{r help.start, eval=FALSE}
help.start()
```

## Useful Links on the help.start() page
- An Introduction to R: This is the basic user manual - it will walk you through several internals. Appendix A (sample session) is useful to get a feel for how to use R.
- User Manuals: This links to manuals for some of the base packages.
- Packages: lists installed packages and links to help pages on the system.
- R Data Import/Export: how to get data in varying formats into R.
- Search Engine: Search for more help.

## help()
```{r help, eval=FALSE}
help("lm")  # inside () is arguments passed to function help
help("help")
?help   # abbriviate the help with ?
help(package="stats") # arguments can be by order or named
```
<article>
We should spend some time talking about function arguments. As you can see by the help page for help, there are several arguments that can passed to the `help` function. If these are passed in order of the function's expected arguments, its, expecting the topic first, then package (which if not specified defaults to NULL), etc. Arguments can be partially matched by title.

## Reading a help() file

`help(topic, package = NULL, lib.loc = NULL,`
`     verbose = getOption("verbose"),`
`     try.all.packages = getOption("help.try.all.packages"),`
`     help_type = getOption("help_type"))`

- arguments for function are between ()
- default arguments are followed by an `=`
- arguments without a `=` are required
- an ellipse `...` means other non specific arguments
- examples are typically at the bottom of the help page 

## help.search()
```{r help.search, eval=FALSE}
help.search("generalized linear model")
```

## Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for programmers, and includes a significant
section on R.

- You can create an account
- Search for questions by tags
- You can ask questions
- You can answer questions and get "reputation points" and "badges"

## RUG listserv

RUG members are quite helpful

- please do not hesitate to post to the listserv if you feel you need help. 
- We are trying to migrate/join the listserv with the community site. 
- Please stay tuned.

## R Project listserv

* https://www.r-project.org/mail.html
* For posting guide: https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html
* Includes special interest projects (for example)
    + R-SIG-Epi: R for epidemiological data analysis
    + R-SIG-meta-analysis: R SIG for discussing the use of R for conducting meta-analyses
    + R-SIG-Geo: R Special Interest Group on using Geographical data and Mapping

 
## Asking Good Questions

- Do your homework
- Provide a self-contained reproducible example
  + Minimal dataset
  + Runnable code to reproduce problem or error
  + Used packages, R version
  + Use `set.seed()` for random data
