An Introduction to rmarkdown (with a few pro tips)

The markdown language, created in 2004, provides a super-simple syntax for creating good-looking, professional documents in a wide range of formats, including HTML, LaTeX, and WORD.  Rmarkdown, created in 2014, allows us to include R code and its output in a markdown document.  Given rmarkdown's ease-of-use and continually-increasing feature set, you should now strongly consider creating all of your documents using rmarkdown -- whether they contain R code and analyses or not -- including: notes to yourself; notes to colleagues; reports to colleagues; standardized recurring reports; scientific journal articles; and even public-facing web pages.  In this talk I will cover markdown and rmarkdown at an introductory level.  Since it's so simple and feature-rich, I'm sure by the end you'll feel confident and motivated enough to begin making your own documents with rmarkdown.
